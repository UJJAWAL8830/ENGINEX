## 📌 About The Project

*JanSetu* is a unified *National Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)* designed to act as a digital backbone connecting *Citizens, **Government Administrators, and **Private Service Developers* on a single interoperable platform.

Today, government services across domains like *Health, **Agriculture, **Urban Governance, and **Security* operate in fragmented silos. JanSetu solves this by introducing a *middleware-driven “Government as a Platform” architecture*, enabling seamless service delivery, data exchange, and innovation—through one national digital gateway.

## ❗ Problem Statement

- Government services operate in isolated silos (Health vs Agriculture vs Urban).
- Poor user experience with multiple portals and logins.
- Massive duplication of citizen data across departments.
- Absence of a unified, interoperable digital infrastructure.

---

## 💡 The Solution: Government as a Platform

JanSetu reimagines governance by providing a shared digital foundation:

### 👥 Citizens
- Single Sign-On (SSO) access to all government services.
- Unified dashboard with personalized, context-aware services.

### 🏛️ Government
- Centralized monitoring of all services.
- Secure inter-department data exchange.
- Real-time analytics for informed decision-making.

### 👨‍💻 Developers
- Plug-and-play API standards.
- Rapid innovation without reinventing core infrastructure.
- Transparent onboarding and application lifecycle tracking.

## 🧠 Technical Innovations

### 🔁 Dynamic Service Injection
Services are *rendered dynamically from the database*, not hardcoded.  
➡️ Adding a new service entry in the DB instantly updates the UI—no redeploy required.

### 🧩 Mock Data Simulation Engine
A simulation layer generates *live-like data* for:
- Weather updates
- Agricultural market prices
- Emergency and incident signals  
Perfect for demonstrating real-world behavior in a hackathon prototype.
